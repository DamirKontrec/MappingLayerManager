# Mapping Layer Manager
A javascript control for working with geographic map (GIS) layers that relies on GISCloud service.

This control is backed up by an example library of classes which provide the basic UI framework for code organisation and extensibility (class system, event model, etc.). The way the code was organised was inspired by ExtJS framework, and was built on top of jQuery library.

[GISCloud](http://www.giscloud.com/) API was used to fetch the mapping data and persist the changes on the service's servers. This is just a front end proof-of-concept.

In the root of the project, inside the **doc.zip** file is the documentation for the project. The documentation is in the HTML format, aotumatically generated by the [JSDuck](https://github.com/senchalabs/jsduck) utility.
